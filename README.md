Issues faced by Users of Software (with Autism)
---------

(A) Distraction from Pop-ups / Notificarions
-------------
A common issue that's faced by persons with Autism is distraction from Pop-ups / Notifications. When Pop-ups / Notifications appear - users can easily get distracted by them and lose focus on the Activity that they're currently performing. Persons with Autism can also get overwhelmed by these Pop-ups / Notifications - and not be in a position to decide what to do next.

Focus Assist on Windows 10
---------
The Focus Assist feature was originally introduced as ‘Quiet Hours’ in previous versions of Windows 10. This feature enables you to avoid unnecessary notifications while you are carrying out a task that demands your focus. You get flexibility in deciding the degree of suppression of notifications. You may maintain a priority list or completely avoid notifications.

In the Focus Assist section, you will also find a heading named Automatic rules. Here you can make the Windows learn the conditions that should enable the Focus Assist automatically. You get the following four conditions to set.

  - During these times: You can set the desired time during which you don’t want any distraction from notifications.
  - When I’m duplicating my display: Enabling this option suppresses notifications as long as you’re projecting your monitor to an external screen.
  - When I’m playing a game: This option prevents notifications while you play games in full-screen mode.
  - When I’m using an app in full-screen mode: This option also blocks notifications as long as you’re using an app in full-screen mode.

(B) Clutter leading to Sensory Overload
---------------
Clutter can be a huge stressor for people with autism because it can contribute to sensory overload and overall stress levels. An unorganized and messy space (a cluttered desktop for instance) can also make simple tasks more difficult because a larger amount of time may need to be dedicated to finding needed files / items.

A user posted the following comments on reddit...
"Yes, but I also have ADHD. I simultaneously want a clean space but will treat clutter as invisible.

When I finally "see" clutter, I will start so rapidly and thoroughly cleaning that I get overwhelmed and then I'll be so burnt out that I can't even consider the thought of cleaning for days. When this happens, I usually end up undoing some of the cleaning I did accomplish."

Clutter is a Reality in life. Eliminating clutter might be possible in some cases - but more difficult in others.

The way we deal with clutter on the Desktop - needs to be reimagined...

FocusedModePlus is just such an Attempt...
